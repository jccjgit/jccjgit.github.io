Imagine the great tragedy of a universe without an expectator. The laws of nature unfolding themselves but with no one to experience any part of it. Imagine the spontaneous creation of a Symphony of such a universal beauty that it would stir the deepests passions in any human upon hearing it...but with no one to hear it. Consciousness, is what prevents this tragedy. 

Nothing is more fundamental than consciousness. We might doubt the existence of the physical world as we see it, think than we are just simulations running on a base reality with different laws of physics. However, the one thing that we can be sure of, is the reality of our own awareness.

<!-- ### Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science

From lecture 1 of Scott Aaronsons's course
:

*"We start with the simplest possible systems, and sets of rules that
we haven’t necessarily confirmed by experiment, but which we just suppose are true, and then ask
what sort of complex systems we can and cannot build."* 

I'm for the first time encountered with the idea that Computer Science is about determining what can and cannot happen, which  *has as much to do with computers as astronomy has to do with telescopes* (Edsger Dijkstra).

It is crucial that we define the machine as having a finite number of states. If the machine had
an infinite number of states, then it could compute absolutely anything, but such an assumption is
physically unrealistic.

In other words, the pigeonhole principle seems obvious to us because we can stand back and
see the larger picture. But a propositional proof system like the ones we saw in the last lecture
can’t do this; it can only reason locally. -->
