At some point, when I was 18, I felt the king of the world. I truly felt that I had the drive, resolve, intelligence, and resourcefulness to acomplish whatever goal I set to myself. The main pilar of this confidence was an explosion of emotional intelligence. I had gone from being a total clueless as to how social interactions unravel, to an emotional genius (according to myself). Whereas most of my conversations ever invariably included akward silences and wtf remarks, I was now consistently having easy flowing animated conversations with complete strangers. I was obtaining help from people without having to explicitly ask, it was an experience akin to telepathy. If I was competing in play, I felt I could anticipate my oponents every movement. I was confident I could be in a conversation with the president of the United States and completely dominate the conversation. I felt pretty much like the main character of limitless when on the pill. At some point I told my girlfriend that I knew exactly what she was thinking just by looking at her. She got scared.

I feel that period was the consequence of an inkling of madness making its way into my conciousness. I have an extensive family history of mental disorder and the probability of getting squizofrenia was high.

This feeling subsided after a couple of months. And my personality stabilized into a more mundane state.

Once in a while, I get a rush in anxiousness and energy. 

From lecture 1 of Scott Aaronsons's course
:

*"We start with the simplest possible systems, and sets of rules that
we haven’t necessarily confirmed by experiment, but which we just suppose are true, and then ask
what sort of complex systems we can and cannot build."* 

I'm for the first time encountered with the idea that Computer Science is about determining what can and cannot happen, which  *has as much to do with computers as astronomy has to do with telescopes* (Edsger Dijkstra).

It is crucial that we define the machine as having a finite number of states. If the machine had
an infinite number of states, then it could compute absolutely anything, but such an assumption is
physically unrealistic.

In other words, the pigeonhole principle seems obvious to us because we can stand back and
see the larger picture. But a propositional proof system like the ones we saw in the last lecture
can’t do this; it can only reason locally.
